# 7 days: day 0

I intend to run an experiment on myself. Don't worry, it's nothing too scary. Here's my mission statement:

> Every day, for 7 days straight:
> - Write 1 note on an interesting topic.
> - Create 1 image/creation/model of some sort.
> - Write a short reflection.
> - Upload all 3 artifacts to my page.

The artifacts could be related to some work I'm currently doing, but they don't have to be. The main goal is to create something and to publish it. I will refrain from doing other work to better understand the time and effort it takes to create these kinds of materials, and to see what kind of quality of work I can expect when time is strict.

Good luck to me!
